# Physics_Project
The project aims at saving energy by detecting the vehicle movement on highways and switching on the block of street light ahead of it and simultaneously switching off the trailing lights. The vitality of this technology arises as fossil fuels is being over consumed which makes it challenging to provide sufficient power in the next era as an effect of growing population. This method provides a sustainable solution in terms of environment, economy, and social needs. In current years, the street light control is automated by changing the resistance using the light-sensitive device. The reliability of this method is less. Though it reduces the man power, it does not conserve energy spent during night time. The aim of Automated lighting is to save energy, and to save cost
